# Savoirfaire Clone Project

This project is a clone of the award-winning site [Savoirfaire NYC](https://www.savoirfaire.nyc), recreated to showcase my web development skills using Next.js and SCSS. It is strictly for educational purposes to demonstrate coding capabilities and understand modern web technologies.

## Demo

You can view the live demo of the project here: [Savoirfaire Clone Demo](https://savoirfaire-clone-git-main-kalpchaudharys-projects.vercel.app/)
